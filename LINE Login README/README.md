# Overview

This is the demo app source code for the [LINE Login](https://lineapiusecase.com/en/api/login.html) provided on the [LINE API Use Case site](https://lineapiusecase.com/en/top.html). LINE Login is a feature that allows you to introduce social login using your LINE account on web apps and native apps (iOS, Android). With LINE Login, users can log in to web apps and native apps (henceforth referred to as services) using their LINE account.

Follow the steps below to build a LINE Login demo app.

The source code environment introduced on this page uses AWS.

# Libraries

## Node.js

Install Node.js, which will be used for the front-end development, in your local development environment.
*We recommend installing the latest LTS version of v10.13 or higher

Node.js download site:

## Python

Install Python version 3.8 or later if it isn't already installed.

You can check if it's installed by entering this command in Command Prompt or Terminal:

```
python --version
```

If Python is installed, the version will be returned. For example:

```
Python 3.8.3
```

Install Python (3.8 or higher), used for back-end development, in your local development environment if it's not already installed.
